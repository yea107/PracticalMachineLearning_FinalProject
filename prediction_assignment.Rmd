```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(caret)
load("prediction_assignment.RData")
```

## Data Selection
We first read training data and testing data from "*pml-training.csv*" and "*pml-testing.csv*", respectively.
The variables we choosen for training are **user_name**, **classe** and information from accelerometers.
Note that there is no **classe** in "*pml-testing.csv*".

```{r read}
rawdata <- read.csv("./pml-training.csv")
rawdata_test <- read.csv("./pml-testing.csv")

col_select_train <- c("user_name","gyros_belt_x","gyros_belt_y","gyros_belt_z","accel_belt_x","accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z","magnet_belt_x","magnet_belt_y","magnet_belt_z","gyros_arm_x","gyros_arm_y","gyros_arm_z","accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z","magnet_arm_x","magnet_arm_y","magnet_arm_z","gyros_dumbbell_x","gyros_dumbbell_y","gyros_dumbbell_z","accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z","magnet_dumbbell_x","magnet_dumbbell_y","magnet_dumbbell_z","gyros_forearm_x","gyros_forearm_y","gyros_forearm_z","accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z","magnet_forearm_x","magnet_forearm_y","magnet_forearm_z","classe")
data_selected <- rawdata[rawdata$new_window != "yes",col_select_train]

col_select_test <- col_select_train[1:length(col_select_train)-1] 
testdata_selected <- rawdata_test[rawdata_test$new_window != "yes",col_select_test]
```

## Partition of Training Data
In training data, we use 75% as true training data and 25% as quizing data.
```{r training-partition}
set.seed(10)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(data_selected$classe, p = 3/4, list=F)
training <- data_selected[inTrain,]
quizing <- data_selected[-inTrain,]
```

## Train the Model
We use **random forest** as classification method.
Although it takes about 1 hour for fitting model, it provide 100% accuracy for quizing data.

```{r train-model, message=FALSE}
ptm <- proc.time()
modFit <- train(classe ~ .,data=data_selected,method="rf")
time <- proc.time() - ptm
pred_quiz <- predict(modFit,quizing)
cmfit <- confusionMatrix(quizing$classe,pred_quiz)
```
```{r}
time
cmfit$table
```

## Prediction for testing data
Finally we predict testing data using fitted model.
``` {r}
pred_test <- predict(modFit,testdata_selected)
pred_test
```
## Result of Course Project Prediction Quiz
The fitted model gives 100% accuracy for testing data.
